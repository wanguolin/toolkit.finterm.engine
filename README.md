**An Open-Source FinTerms Engine Powered by DeepSeek-V3**

## What's Inside?

FinTerms is an auto-generated financial dictionary that combines **prompts engineering** with **AI-native design**, delivering: 

âœ¨ **Structured Terminology**  
`Markdown-native` formatting with strict bilingual alignment (CN/EN).

ðŸ¤– **DeepSeek-V3 Powered**  
Leveraging the cost-efficient architecture of DeepSeek's latest LLM for sustainable content generation at industry-leading rates:
- Input: $0.014-0.14 per 1M tokens
- Output: $0.28 per 1M tokens
- 64K context window

ðŸ“š **Structured Knowledge Architecture**  
- Dual-language synchronized definitions and explanations
- Historical context and origin tracking
- Practical application scenarios and risk notes
- Regulatory and market significance analysis
- Structured key takeaways for quick reference
- LLM-reviewed entries based on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/)'s Daily FinTermsÂ¹

Â¹ *The original word list is from [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/)'s Daily FinTerms. It was filtered and expanded by Gemini Advanced Experimental 2.0, then reviewed by DeepSeek-V3 using this code: [meta/dict_review.py](meta/dict_review.py)*

## API Pricing

*Cost estimate based on a 500-word bilingual entry (~2000 tokens): input cost $0.00028 + output cost $0.00056 â‰ˆ $0.00084 per entry*
